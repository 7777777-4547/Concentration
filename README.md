# Concentration
Add borderless support for minecraft.

This project is based on Jared's [MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template), it's convenient to develop multi loader mod I admit that however I can't make one jar that can use both on fabric and neoforge. So maybe in the future I will find another template to rewrite this mod, so that I can only compile one jar for all the platforms.

### A method to test if the borderless works
Try use [snipaste](https://www.snipaste.com) to take screenshot, if the screenshot shows exactly what you see in the game, means borderless works. If the screenshot taken is a previous-seen picture, means borderless not works.
