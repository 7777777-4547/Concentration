# Concentration
Add borderless support for minecraft

This project is based on Jared's [MultiLoader-Template](https://github.com/jaredlll08/MultiLoader-Template), it's convenient to develop multi loader mod I admit that however I can't make one jar that can use both on fabric and neoforge. So maybe in the future I will find another template to rewrite this mod, so that I can only compile one jar for all the platforms.
